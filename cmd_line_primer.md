# Commandline primer

ls - shows you the contents of the current directory

cd - allows you to move from one directory to another

Example:
cd .. sends you up one level in the directory structure
cd [folder name] sends you to the folder named [folder name]
Detailed example:
[type this in]
mkdir foo #mkdir makes a new directory for you - how awesome is that?!?!
cd foo
ls #(should print nothing)
